    "Mathematical optimization is a large area of research in applied mathematics. There are many applications in science and technology. Recently, there is a particular focus on this area due to its importance in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and as a potential candidate application for quantum computing algorithms.\n",

    "In a broader context, optimization problems involve maximizing or minimizing a real-valued function by systematically choosing input values from within an allowed set and computing the value of the function.\n",

    "Optimization problems can be divided into two categories, depending on whether the variables are continuous or discrete:\n",
    "* An optimization problem is known as discrete if it involves finding an argument from a countable set such as an integer, permutation or graph.\n",
    "* A problem is known as a continuous optimization if arguments from a continuous set must be found.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function $C$ has various names in different applications. It can be called a cost function, objective function or loss function (minimization), a utility function or fitness function (maximization), or, in certain fields, an energy function or energy functional. A feasible solution that minimizes (or maximizes, if that is the goal) the objective function is in general called an optimal solution.\n",

    "for some $\\delta > 0$ is known as a *local minimum*.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, unless the cost function is convex in a minimization problem, there may be several local minima within $V$. In a convex problem, if there is a local minimum that is interior (not on the edge of the set of feasible elements), it is also the global minimum, but a nonconvex problem may have more than one local minimum not all of which need be global minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the linear regression model we could find the best fit parameters by solving the normal equation. Although we could encounter problems associated with inverting a matrix, we do in principle have a closed-form expression for the model parameters. In general, however, the problem of optimizing the model parameters is a very difficult one. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that the majority of available optimizers are not capable of making a distinction between locally optimal and globally optimal solutions. They will therefore, erroneously, treat the former as actual solutions to the global optimization problem."
