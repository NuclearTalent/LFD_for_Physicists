    "In this chapter we use Bayes' theorem to infer a (posterior) probability density function for parameters of a *linear statistical model*, conditional on data $\\data$. \n",
    "This is called Bayesian linear regression (BLR).\n",
    "In this context \"linear\" means that the parameters we seek to infer appear in the model only to the first power (specific examples below).\n",
    "You may already be familiar with ordinary (frequentist) linear regression, such as making a least-squares fit of a polynomial to data; later in this chapter we will show how this is related to BLR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of doing *Bayesian* instead of frequentist linear regression are many. The Bayesian approach yields a probability distribution for the unknown parameters and for future model predictions. It also enables us to make all assumptions explicit whereas the frequentist approach puts nearly all emphasis on the collected data. These assumptions can be more general as well; e.g., they allow you to specify prior beliefs on the parameters (such as slope and intercept for a straight line model). Finally, we can do straightforward model checking and add a discrepancy model to account for limitations of the linear model being considered. \n",

    "In **linear modeling** the dependence on the model parameters $\\parsLR$ is **linear**, and this fact will make it possible, for certain priors, to find the distribution of model parameters analytically. Note that we will mostly operate with models depending on more than one parameter. Hence, we denote the model parameters ($\\parsLR$) using a bold symbol. (We reserve the generic symbol $\\pars$ to include not only $\\parsLR$ but also any other parameters specifying our statistical model.) In this chapter we will, however, consider models ($\\modeloutput$) that relate a single dependent variable ($\\output$) with a single independent one ($\\inputt$).\n",

    "\n",
    "To warm up, and get acquainted with the notation and formalism, let us work out a small example. Assume that we have the situation where we have collected two datapoints $\\data = [y_1,y_2]^T = [-3,3]^T$ for the predictor values $[x_1,x_2]^T = [-2,1]^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data could have come from any process, even a non-linear one. But this is artificial data that I generated by evaluating the function $y = 1 + 2x$ at $x=x_1=-2$ and $x=x_2=1$. Clearly, the data-generating mechanism is very simple and corresponds to a linear model $y = \\paraLR_0 + \\paraLR_1 x$ with $[\\paraLR_0,\\paraLR_1] = [1,2]$. This is the kind of information we *never* have in reality. Indeed, we are always uncertain about the process that maps input to output, and as such our model $M$ will always be wrong. We are also uncertain about the parameters $\\parsLR$ of our model. These are the some of the fundamental reasons for why it can be useful to operate with a Bayesian approach where we can assign probabilities to any quantity and statement. In this example, however, we will continue with the standard (frequentist) approach based on finding the parameters that minimize the squared errors (i.e., the norm of the residual vector).\n",

    "In the present case the two unknowns $\\parsLR = [\\paraLR_0,\\paraLR_1]^T$ can be fit to the two datapoints $\\data = [-3,3]^T$ using pen a paper. \n",

    "```{exercise}\n",

    "\n",
    "This time we also have prior knowledge that we would like to build into the inference. Here we use a normal prior for the parameters with $\\sigma_\\paraLR = 5.0$, which is to say that before looking at the data we believe the pdf for $\\parsLR$ to be centered on zero with a variance of $5^2$.\n",

Let's use python to generate some more realistic, yet artificial, data. Using the function below you can generate data from some linear process with random variables for the underlying parameters. We call this a data-generating process."
