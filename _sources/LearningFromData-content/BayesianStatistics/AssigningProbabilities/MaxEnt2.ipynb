    "1. Imagine a very large number of monkeys throwing $N$ balls into $M$ equally sized boxes. The final number of balls in box $i$ is $n_i$.\n",

    "   * The distribution of balls $\\{ n_i \\}$ divided by $N$ is therefore a candidate pdf $\\{ p_i \\}$.\n",
    "2. After one round the monkeys have distributed their (huge number of) balls over the $M$ boxes.\n",
    "   * The resulting pdf might not be consistent with the constraints in $I$, however, in which case it must be rejected as a possible candidate.\n",
    "   * The candidate pdf is recorded by an independent observer in the scenario that the constraints are in fact fulfilled.\n",
    "3. After many such rounds, some distributions will be found to come up more often than others. \n",
    "   * The one that appears most frequently (and satisfies $I$) would be a sensible choice for $p(\\{p_i\\}|I)$.\n",
    "   * Since our ideal monkeys have no agenda of their own to influence the distribution, this most favoured distribution can be regarded as the one that best represents our given state of knowledge.\n",
    "   * No bananas are allowed!\n",

The interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty that remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been properly taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. Specifically, entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of micro-states with significant probability of being occupied $S = -k_B \\sum_i p_i \\log(p_i)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n",

    "2. Logical consistency (Shore & Johnson, 1960).\n",
    "3. Uncorrelated assignments related monotonically to $S$ (Skilling, 1988).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the third argument. Let us check it empirically in the context of the problem of hair colour and handedness of Scandinavians. We are interested in determining $p_1 \\equiv p(L,B|I) \\equiv x$, the probability that a Scandinavian is both left-handed and blonde. However, in this simple example we can immediately realize that the assignment $p_1=0.07$ is the only one that implies no correlation between left-handedness and hair color. Any joint probability smaller than 0.07 implies that left-handed people are less likely to be blonde, and any larger vale indicates that left-handed people are more likely to be blonde.\n",
