    "\n",
    "Computational Bayesian methods, and many other applications, have a need for models that can be solved at different fidelities. High fidelity implies high precision, but also high computational cost. Low fidelity versions of the model are much faster to evaluate, but associated with a smaller precision. They are still very useful for model calibration and statistical studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vast theory of model-order reduction for scientific applications. See, e.g., Ref. {cite}`Melendez:2022kid` for an overview and many useful references. Let us broadly categorize them into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Model-order reduction\n",
    "**Date driven**: Non-intrusive approaches where the output of a high-fidelity model is interploated (or even dangerously extrapolated) without the need for detailed access to the model. Two examples are:\n",
    "- Gaussian process regression models\n",
    "- Artificial neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model driven**: Intrusive approaches where reduced-order equations are derived from the high-fidelity equations. These methods require a deeper understanding of the model and respect the underlying structure. They often use projection and will be able to extrapolate. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A large subset of model-driven approaches are known as **Reduced-Basis Methods** {cite}`Quarteroni2015`. We will mainly be concerned with **eigenvector continuation** {cite}`Frame:2017fah`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will use model-order reduction to emulate our model, that is we will replace the high-fidelity version $M(\\pars)$ with a low-fidelity emulator $\\tilde M(\\pars)$ which is much faster to evaluate but hopefully acceptably accurate. We will need to keep track of the emulator uncertainty via quantification of $\\var{M(\\pars) - \\tilde M(\\pars)} \\equiv \\var{\\delta \\tilde M (\\pars)}$. We will often neglect the parameter dependence such that \n",

    "## Eigenvector continuation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will specifically consider emulation based on eigenvector continuation as a type of reduced-order model. This method is very useful for applications where the computer model can be phrased as an eigenvalue problem. For example, consider the prediction of the eigenenergy of a quantum state such that $M(\\pars) = E(\\pars)$ is obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation\n",

    "This equation can be projected onto a suitable basis and thereby expressed as a matrix eigenvalue problem for which the eigenstate, $| \\psi(\\pars) \\rangle$, becomes an eigenvector. In certain applications it might be that the dimension $N$ of this basis is very large. In quantum many-body simulations you might have $N \\sim 10^9$ or even larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a statistical analysis we must explore the consequences of varying the numerical values of $\\pars$. In, e.g., MCMC sampling we might need many thousands (or much more) model evaluations and must therefore seek a way to mitigate the computational cost of solving for $E_\\odot \\equiv E(\\pars_\\odot)$ (and $| \\psi_\\odot \\rangle \\equiv | \\psi(\\pars_\\odot) \\rangle$) for any target parametrization $\\pars_\\odot$ of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight of eigenvector continuation {cite}`Frame:2017fah` is that although an eigenvector resides in a linear space with enormous dimensions, the eigenvector trajectory generated by smooth changes of the Hamiltonian matrix is well approximated by a very low-dimensional manifold in many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore start by constructing a basis of $n \\ll N$ eigenvectors $\\{ | \\psi_i \\rangle \\}_{i=1}^n$ obtained from exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation at different model parametrizations $\\{ \\pars_i \\}_{i=1}^n$. These solutions are known as *snapshots*. We then diagonalize the Schrödinger equation for the target parametrization $\\pars_\\odot$ in this (non-orthogonal) snapshot basis\n",
