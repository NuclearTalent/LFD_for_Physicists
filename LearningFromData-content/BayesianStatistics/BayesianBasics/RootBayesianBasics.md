# Bayesian methods for scientific modeling

In this part we introduce the basics of Bayesian statistics.
We've divided the material into chapters on:
* {ref}`ch:Inferenceandpdfs`, with an introduction to Bayes' theorem and other ingredients of Bayesian statistical analysis, including our first look at parameter estimation;
* {ref}`sec:BayesianPosteriors`, with explorations of probability density (or distribution) functions (PDFs);
* {ref}`sec:UpdatingBayes`, with interactive guides to the updating of PDFs when additional knowledge is acquired; 
* {ref}`sec:BayesInPractice`, with a summary of the advantages of the Bayesian framework, elaboration of the Bayesian workflow, and a detailed example on Bayesian linear regression that puts together all of the ingredients.

Good supplementary references for this material that are particularly physicist-friendly are Chapters 1 and 2 in Sivia {cite}`Sivia2006`; Chapter 1 from Gregory {cite}`Gregory2005`; and the article by Trotta {cite}`Trotta:2008qt`.

Many of the examples in Sivia have been implemented in Jupyter notebooks that you can work through as we proceed. You are highly encouraged to answer the questions in the notebooks, play with different values for the parameters, and extend the examples.

Additional material on scientific modeling can be found in Appendix A. See {ref}`sec:RootScientificModeling`.
